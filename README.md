# MerchantStory

**MerchantStory** is a pet project, inspired by the gameplay style of *Reigns*. In this game, you play as a wandering merchant of curiosities, collecting strange and magical items during your travels. You fulfill customer orders, search for specific goods, craft complex items from gathered components, and immerse yourself in a mystical world.  

Every action you take has a time cost, and certain activities are influenced by weather and other external factors.

## Development Notes

This project is developed in my spare time, so there are no strict deadlines—progress may take as long as needed. For me, the main goal is to have fun creating something personal.
